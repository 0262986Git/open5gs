#### Status Update
An issue with MME has been reported in issues [#472](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/472). To solve this problem, I freeze the code for the time being and changed the process to terminate if any problems are found including ogs_expect().

Here's what I know about this issue: There seems to be a problem with mme-init.c under version 1.3.0. I found that the eventloop is implemented incorrectly, and I am suspecting that this is related to current mme's infinite loop.

Anyway, if you need it for the experiment, please send the related log. And if necessary, I will provide a release package to catch this bug.

#### For troubleshooting
- ogs_expect() calls ogs_abort() temporarily ([#472](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/472)) -- [theorem6](https://github.com/theorem6), [bladebeam](https://github.com/bladebeam), [cabotek](https://github.com/cabotek)
